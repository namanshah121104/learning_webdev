## 🧠 About This Project

This **HTML Cheatsheet** is a personally curated, dark-themed quick reference guide for learning and revising HTML fundamentals.
I built this as part of my web development learning journey to have everything — from the boilerplate structure to responsive design — neatly organized in one file.

## 🌈 Customization

You can easily change the theme by modifying the CSS inside the `<style>` tag.
For example:

```css
body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  color: #000000;
}
```

will switch it to a light mode.
